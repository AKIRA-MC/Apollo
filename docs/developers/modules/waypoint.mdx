# Waypoint Module

## Overview

The waypoint module allows you to interact with the waypoints mod for Lunar Client players.

- Ability to display custom waypoints for players on Lunar Client.
    - Set exact location highlights using waypoints.
    - Custom colors can be provided.
    - Supply a custom name for the waypoint.
    - Control the ability to remove the waypoint. (They will always have the option to disable the waypoint, even if you prevent it from being deleted client-side.)
    - Control if the waypoint is set to be visible by default.

## Integration

```java
public void displayWaypointExample(Player viewer) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(viewer.getUniqueId());

    apolloPlayerOpt.ifPresent(apolloPlayer -> {
        this.waypointModule.displayWaypoint(apolloPlayer, Waypoint.builder()
            .name("KoTH")
            .location(ApolloBlockLocation.builder()
                .world("world")
                .x(500)
                .y(100)
                .z(500)
                .build()
            )
            .color(Color.ORANGE)
            .preventRemoval(false) // If the player can delete the waypoint
            .visible(true)
            .build()
        );
    });
}
```

### `Waypoint` Options

`.name(String)` is the name of the waypoint. Keep in mind this is displayed to players.

```java
.name("KoTH")
```

`.location(ApolloBlockLocation)` is the location of the block the waypoint should display on. See the [locations utilities page](/apollo/developers/utilities/locations) for more.

```java
.location(ApolloBlockLocation.builder()
    .world("world") // The world the waypoint should display in
    .x(500)
    .y(100)
    .z(500)
    .build()
)
```

`.color(java.awt.Color)` is how you dictate the color of the waypoint. See the [colors page](/apollo/developers/utilities/colors) for more.

```java
.color(Color.ORANGE)
```

`.preventRemoval(String)` sets if the player is able to delete the waypoint client-side.

```java
.preventRemoval(false) // If the player can delete the waypoint
```

`.visible(Boolean)` if the player is able to see the waypoint or not.

```java
.visible(true)
```

### Removing a specific waypoints for a player

```java
public void removeWaypointExample(Player viewer) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(viewer.getUniqueId());
    apolloPlayerOpt.ifPresent(apolloPlayer -> this.waypointModule.removeWaypoint(apolloPlayer, "KoTH"));
}
```

### Resetting all waypoints for a player

```java
public void resetWaypointsExample(Player viewer) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(viewer.getUniqueId());
    apolloPlayerOpt.ifPresent(this.waypointModule::resetWaypoints);
}
```
