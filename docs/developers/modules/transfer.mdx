# Transfer Module

## Overview

Our transfer module contains both a transfer packet and a ping packet.
If used correctly, both these packets can be very powerful.
The transfer packet will allow you to send Lunar Client players to different servers, using the IP address.
The ping packet will allow you to ping different IP addresses to get the players current ping to that server.
When you combine the two packets, you can do connection optimizing for your players, so they're always connected to the best server available.
You can use these features to create multi-server networks, without the requirement of additional proxy setups.

When you attempt to transfer a player, they're greeted with a pop-up notification warning them they're about to be transferred from one server to another.
The player has the option to prevent the transfer by clicking "cancel" or if they wish to proceed they can click "accept" and be transferred.
You cannot prevent this notification, however players can opt-in to "trust" your server, to prevent the pop-up from being displayed on future request.

## Integration

We're going to give you a brief overview of both the ping packet and transfer packet, respectively.

### Ping Packet

{/* insert code example of ping packet */}

```java
public void pingExample(Player player) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(player.getUniqueId());

    if (apolloPlayerOpt.isEmpty()) {
        player.sendMessage(Component.text("Join with Lunar Client to test this feature!"));
        return;
    }

    transferModule.ping(apolloPlayerOpt.get(), List.of("mc.hypixel.net", "minehut.com"))
        .onSuccess(response -> {
            for (PingResponse.PingData pingData : response.getData()) {
                String message = switch (pingData.getStatus()) {
                    case SUCCESS -> String.format("Ping to %s is %d ms.", pingData.getServerIp(), pingData.getPingMillis());
                    case TIMED_OUT -> String.format("Failed to ping %s", pingData.getServerIp());
                };

                player.sendMessage(Component.text(message, NamedTextColor.YELLOW));
            }
        })
        .onFailure(exception -> {
            player.sendMessage(Component.text("Internal error! Check console!"));
            exception.printStackTrace();
        });
}
```

### Transfer Packet

{/* insert code example of trasnfer packet */}

```java
public void transferExample(Player player) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(player.getUniqueId());

    if (apolloPlayerOpt.isEmpty()) {
        player.sendMessage(Component.text("Join with Lunar Client to test this feature!"));
        return;
    }

    transferModule.transfer(apolloPlayerOpt.get(), "mc.hypixel.net")
        .onSuccess(response -> {
            String message = switch (response.getStatus()) {
                case ACCEPTED -> "Transfer accepted! Goodbye!";
                case REJECTED -> "Transfer rejected by client!";
            };

            player.sendMessage(Component.text(message, NamedTextColor.YELLOW));
        })
        .onFailure(exception -> {
            player.sendMessage(Component.text("Internal error! Check console!"));
            exception.printStackTrace();
        });
    }
```
