# Transfer Module

## Overview

The transfer module allows you to transfer players from one server to another, without the need of additional proxy setups, using the transfer packet. We've also introduced a ping packet to get a players ping to other servers.

- Adds the ability to use the `Transfer Packet` and `Ping Packet` on players.
  - Ability to transfer players from one server to another
  - Ability to ping other servers, to get a players ping to those servers.

When you combine the usage of the ping packet and transfer packet, you can do connection based optimizing for your players.

<Callout type="warning">
  Players are prompted with a confirmation screen, where they can accept or decline the transfer-packet.

## Integration

### Using the Transfer Packet

```java
public void transferExample(Player viewer) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(viewer.getUniqueId());

    if (apolloPlayerOpt.isEmpty()) {
        viewer.sendMessage(Component.text("Join with Lunar Client to test this feature!"));
        return;
    }

    // Sending the transfer request to the player, to transfer them to "mc.hypixel.net"
    this.transferModule.transfer(apolloPlayerOpt.get(), "mc.hypixel.net")
        .onSuccess(response -> {
            String message = switch (response.getStatus()) {

                // If the player accepts the transfer request
                case ACCEPTED -> "Transfer accepted! Goodbye!";

                // If the player declines the transfer request
                case REJECTED -> "Transfer rejected by client!";
            };
    
            viewer.sendMessage(Component.text(message, NamedTextColor.YELLOW));
        })
        .onFailure(exception -> {
            viewer.sendMessage(Component.text("Internal error! Check console!"));
            exception.printStackTrace();
        });
}
```

### Using the Ping Packet

```java
public void pingExample(Player viewer) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(viewer.getUniqueId());

    if (apolloPlayerOpt.isEmpty()) {
        viewer.sendMessage(Component.text("Join with Lunar Client to test this feature!"));
        return;
    }

    // Sending the ping request to the player, for the servers "mc.hypixel.net" & "minehut.com".
    this.transferModule.ping(apolloPlayerOpt.get(), List.of("mc.hypixel.net", "minehut.com"))
        .onSuccess(response -> {
            for (PingResponse.PingData pingData : response.getData()) {
                String message = switch (pingData.getStatus()) {
                    
                    // Successful ping request display the server IP and the players ping to that server.
                    case SUCCESS -> String.format("Ping to %s is %d ms.", pingData.getServerIp(), pingData.getPingMillis());
                    
                    // If the ping request times-out
                    case TIMED_OUT -> String.format("Failed to ping %s", pingData.getServerIp());
                };

                viewer.sendMessage(Component.text(message, NamedTextColor.YELLOW));
            }
        })
        .onFailure(exception -> {
            viewer.sendMessage(Component.text("Internal error! Check console!"));
            exception.printStackTrace();
        });
}
```
