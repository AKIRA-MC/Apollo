## Integration

### Sample Code (Method 1)

```java
public class GeneralExample1 implements ApolloListener {

    public GeneralExample1() {
        EventBus.getBus().register(this);
    }

    @Listen
    public void onApolloRegister(ApolloRegisterPlayerEvent event) {
        ((Player) event.getPlayer()).sendMessage("You have joined using LunarClient!");
    }
}
```

### Sample Code (Method 2)

```java
public class GeneralExample2 implements ApolloListener {

    public GeneralExample2() {
        this.handle(ApolloRegisterPlayerEvent.class, this::onApolloRegister);
    }

    public void onApolloRegister(ApolloRegisterPlayerEvent event) {
        ((Player) event.getPlayer()).sendMessage("You have joined using LunarClient!");
    }
}
```

## Creating Apollo events

### Creating the event class

```java
// Normal event
public class CoolApolloEvent implements Event {

    private final ApolloPlayer player;

    public CoolApolloEvent(ApolloPlayer player) {
        this.player = player;
    }

    public ApolloPlayer getPlayer() {
        return this.player;
    }
}

// Cancellable event
public class CoolApolloCancellableEvent implements EventCancellable {

    private final ApolloPlayer player;

    private boolean cancelled;

    public CoolApolloCancellableEvent(ApolloPlayer player) {
        this.player = player;
    }

    public ApolloPlayer getPlayer() {
        return this.player;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isCancelled() {
        return this.cancelled;
    }

    @Override
    public void setCancelled(boolean cancel) {
        this.cancelled = cancel;
    }
}
```

### Calling the created event

```java
// Calling a normal event
public void callCoolApolloEvent(ApolloPlayer player) {
    CoolApolloEvent event = new CoolApolloEvent(player);
    EventBus.EventResult<CoolApolloEvent> result = EventBus.getBus().post(event);

    for (Throwable throwable : result.getThrowing()) {
        throwable.printStackTrace();
    }
}

// Calling a cancellable event
public void callCoolApolloCancellableEvent(ApolloPlayer player) {
    CoolApolloCancellableEvent event = new CoolApolloCancellableEvent(player);
    EventBus.EventResult<CoolApolloCancellableEvent> result = EventBus.getBus().post(event);

    if (!result.getEvent().isCancelled()) {
        // Do some action if the event is not cancelled
    }

    for (Throwable throwable : result.getThrowing()) {
        throwable.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
