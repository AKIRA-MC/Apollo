# Acceptable Use

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This page describes acceptable use of Apollo according to Moonsworth, LLC. Please note that
  any experiences you create must still be compliant with the Minecraft EULA.
</Callout>

## Current modules
All current Apollo modules are available for use by all servers, without charge. The intent of
Apollo is to help servers create amazing experiences for Lunar Client players, not to monetize
the API.

## Future modules
We _may_ release future Apollo modules / features that require an approval process for servers
to use. This would be done if a new module / feature is:
  * Something that requires backing infrastructure we're unable to provide for free
  * Something we're required to keep exclusive for a certain period of time
  * Something that directly competes with our [store](https://store.lunarclient.com)


## Questions
If you have further questions about acceptable use, you can join the [Apollo discord](https://discord.gg/ww4UhsPNwf).
